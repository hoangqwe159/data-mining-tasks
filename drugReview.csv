1,ortho-tri-cyclen,1,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,"Although this type of birth control has more cons than pros, it did help with my cramps. It's also effective with the prevention of pregnancy. (Along with use of condoms as well)"
2,ponstel,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"I was used to having cramps so badly that they would leave me balled up in bed for at least 2 days.

3,prilosec,3,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,"The acid reflux went away for a few months after just a few days of being on the drug. The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a ""treatment for the symptoms"". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life."

8,xanax,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects.

35,propecia,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose."

This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.

244,vivelle-dot,9,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"The treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  This estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  Estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  I felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.  I love this medication."
245,lexapro,4,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,My obsessive thoughts completely disappeared. This was a huge relief because before that I was comparing myself to others 24/7. I was able to handle stressful situations calmly. Nothing could make me upset.
246,wellbutrin,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"increased energy. better focus. better sex drive. more ""alive"" than when only taking lexapro and loestrin."
247,relafen,5,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"The only benefit I received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month."
248,valium,6,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"It was beneficial for alleviating nervousness and feelings of anxiety. I took one half tablet or a full tablet depending upon how anxious or nervous I was feeling. If particularly anxious/nervous sometimes I took one tablet plus a half. I didn't take this medication on a daily basis, but only when I was going to be involved in a nerve wracking experience."
249,yasmin,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"I've been on yasmin four years now, it works so great! I have no side effects, just nausea if I take two at a time and that is hardly ever.  But my acne completely went away and no pregnancy the whole time I've been on it! Would definently recommend to anybody."
250,klonopin,1,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,None.  I went from 140lbs down to 98lbs.  I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues.

252,provigil,7,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,Was often so tired that I barely got through my work day and would go home and sleep.  My quality of life was pretty much non-existant as I didn't enjoy anthing because I was always too tired.  When I started provigil I quit feeling like I always needed a nap and was able to make plans with friends because I had the energy to do more than just get through 9 to 11 hour work days.
253,mirapex,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"My legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies."

255,provera,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,The treatment benefits of taking Provera were very good. I had very irregular menses that lasted for long periods of time.  By taking the Provera day 15-26 of my cycle my periods began to normalize and become regular again.
256,adipex-p,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,Upon first taking the medication it significantly reduced my hunger almost to the point that I had to remind myself to eat during the day.  It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over.
257,provigil,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,"I couldn't tolerate the side effects, so I was unable to experience the benefits."

It also helps to calm, and smooth over the rough spots of daily living, while not robbing you of your personality, ie, you still feel like yourself, just calmer."
260,aldara,6,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,aldara was used on several areas on my face where i had scar revision surgery to help heal surgical wound on face.  It was prescribed by my doctor to speed up healing.

268,depo-provera,1,Highly Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,I did not get pregnant while on the depo shot... but then again my sex life was shot due to the constant bleeding.
269,flexeril,7,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,I am able to get good restful sleep and that is so important in my pain management.
270,chantix,2,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,It seemed to help make me not want to smoke. I seemed to not even think about smoking at times i would normally smoke. I think it would be very efective if the side effects werent so great.
271,metronidazole,10,Highly Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,"Personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.

during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.

it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.

Within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my A* papers and my mental health.

With that i have only this to say:
Take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  This will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries."
272,dispermox,3,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,Cured the tonsilitis/strep throat
273,ambien,7,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,Is very helpful with insomnia.  Was able to put racing thoughts that run threw my mind at rest.  Was able to get into a deep sleep.
274,zoloft,4,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"The drug did seem to make me feel more confident at the beginning, however towards the 10 11 months it didn't seem to work anymore."
275,depo-provera,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"After the first two shots I had no more periods until after being off Depo Provera for nearly 3 months. Also I didn't get pregnant, which was the goal. Before getting on birth control I had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom I really didn't want to fight. On the shot I still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong."
276,doxycycline,6,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,So far so good. Will know more after six month mark when x-rays are taken to see if pockets are closing. One area that was highly inflamed before the deep cleaning appears to be healing well. No inflammation there and more pink as opposed to the red color it was before.
277,solodyn,1,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,"I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn."
278,suboxone,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life."
279,effexor-xr,2,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,I could not see any benefits. I certainly did not feel any more emotionally balanced or stable than before.
280,zmax,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"This treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  Although I didn't miss any dose times, if I had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  If the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage."

286,vyvanse,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"I needed to switch from straterra which made me very very depressed quiet and i slept for like an hour each night with that drug it was horrible. I switched to Vyvanse and the first time i took it, it was like an anti deppresant at first i was the normal happy hyper me but i could still focus very well on studying but when i started comming down from it that was the worst i was dry heaving with a TERRIBLE HEADACHE for an hour and then i would just throw everything up it made me very irritated i would twitch ALOT and my heart beat was fast and very heavy but after my second day my body started getting use to it and i havent had anymore problems with it."
287,paxil-cr,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"It allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that I could not ignore before. Basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore."
288,ativan,2,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,"At first, could actually sleep. The sleep issue has been life long and various natural things helped but not always.  As stress increased, nothing helped,not even the Ativan."
289,effexor-xr,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,My symptoms of depression were eased considerably.  I felt more like myself and began to take pleasure in activities. I stopped feeling sad and crying. I was able to concentrate again.  My appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized.
290,prempro,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"I had severe hot flashes all day and night. The night episodes kept me awake most of the night with alternating hot, sweaty flashes, followed by teeth-rattling chills.  Prempro eliminated the vast majority of episodes so i could sleep"
291,darvocet-n,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"The Darvocet helped with the pain very well in the beginning after returning home from the hospital, but within a week and a half I began to feel as if it weren't helping as much and I needed more. After my two weeks were up on taking it, I gradually just didn't need it any more."
292,ranitidine,5,Marginally Effective,No Side Effects,"Decreased redness and bumpiness by day 6. I believe the benefits were associated with the prescribed medication. However, I was also using a histamine blocking topical cream during the course of treatment."
293,prevacid,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"the prevacid allows me to eat and drink certain foods/fluids that I normally could not tolerate anymore without great discomfort i.e. spicy foods, coffee, chocolate, tomato products, and alcholic drinks, which I only drink occassionally such as red wine.  If I skip the prevacid for any reason, I almost certainly will be very uncomfortable."
294,amoxil,10,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours."
295,septra,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"My daughter suffered from an outbreak of painful skin boils on her lower back and stomach, probably 6 total over a few weeks.  They would heal individually after draining (also painful) but more would continually form.  The doctor diagnosed them as caused by MRSA and prescribed Septra along with daily washes with hibiclens soap.  It took 5 days for one very large, undrained boil to heal, but it did heal without draining.  More importantly, the boils stopped forming."
296,tamiflu,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"'Was diagnosed with H1N1 and was ill for at little past 3 weeks.  My doctor gave me a prescription for Tamiflu (2 x day for 5 days) on the 3rd day after becoming rapidly ill (onset of high fever -- temp went from 102.8 to 103.2 pretty fast).  Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course."

I tried to taper off of it and fould it very difficult the lowest doesage i can take is 100mg.  a little drowsy in the morning but after a couple of cups of coffee im fine.
302,zyprexa,3,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,There was very little benefit to me. I was having psychotic episodes every day. The drug puportedly taken to stop the episodes did nothing. The best thing it did was make me drowsy and help me sleep.
303,yasmin,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,pregnancy prevention
304,lexapro,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Significantly decreased depression and suicidality, improved sleep, more stable moods and increased energy."

311,lyrica,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"lessening of nerve pain, decrease in depression. Medication will be increased as nessesary. Decrease in parathesis, shaking. Exercise is needed to truly relieve pain. Water based therapy can definetely add to releif from pain. Depression medication helps, relieving the other symptoms, and can increase sleep. In general all treatments, Lyrica, anti-depressants, muscle relaxers and exercise program (including stretching, weight-resistance, aerobic and endurance training and water excerises - this should be followed religiously) combined contribute to relieving pain, depression, control weight gain, and give patient back some resemblance of a normal live."
312,cymbalta,9,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"This medication saved my life. The depression had gotten so sever that I was unable to function properly. It has made me feel like a 'real' person again. It has not done much for the anxiety, panic, or OCD. The Xanax helps with that area. I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression. Try not to take Celexa for cost reasons, Lexapro shows much more promise in its effectiveness."
313,imitrex,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,this drug will make a migriane sufferer inot a real believer in modern medicine--it really gets rid of the headache and allows you to live. I could not be more positive
314,voltaren,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"Without the Voltarin, every step I take makes my joints feel like cracking glass and they ache constantly. This drug greatly reduces that pain throughout the entire day."
315,tetracycline,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"The product took great care of my razor bumps.  If I applied it at night, I was clear by the morning.  I only stopped taking it as the condition itself lessened."
316,valtrex,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. This treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which I felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours."
317,zovirax,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,If I took the Zovirax at the first sign of tingling it would prevent an outbreak.  If I waited I would still get blisters but they would only last 2-3 days.

320,retin-a,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"After I built up a tolerance, I had little peeling when I applied it only once a day. Used in combination with Erthyrom. caplets (and also topical, used occasionally), I have been able to control deep acne cysts. While the Erthyrom. is probably the major factor, the Retin-A is a good addition."
321,relpax,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"Relpax would take the migraine headache away, including secondary symptoms such as neck aches, jaw pain, and nausea."
322,follistim,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,I got pregnant.
323,effexor,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"In comparison with other antidepression medications I have taken prior to the effexor, It actually began working faster than the others (after about 2 weeks).  Most antidepressants usually take closer to 4 weeks to see improvements. Depression symptoms were significantly reduced."
324,lortab,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Had surgery on my neck, the lortab reduce the pain.The lortab help relieve th pain upto eight hours so I did not need to take as many pills to find release. This is a good thing because I do not like pills.  This medication helped tremedously."
325,climara,8,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"My moods have improved dramatically.  I would wake at least 3 times a night and have difficulty going back to sleep (sleep was always a problem), but now sleep is much better.  Hot flashes were intense and distracting, and have since stopped.  I originally took Premarin which gave me headaches.  The patch and it's consistent delivery has helped immensely to reduce number and severity of headaches."
326,requip,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"While standing, my legs were fine, but aching, cramping legs were keeping me from getting any sleep.  My doctor suggested I try Requip, and its been the best thing I have done."
327,accutane,4,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"I had the Accutane treatment in 1997 and the short term results (6 months - 1 years) were fantastic, with the exception that the treatment left a big scar on my face and there is nothing I can do about it. After a year I began to have acne breakouts again. Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry. Hope this helps somebody out there! Bea"
328,percocet,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,relieved pain at first but quickly became tolerant and wouls wear off hours before the next dose was due
329,celexa,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it."
330,restasis,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"Restasis dramatically improved issues related to dry eyes, the primary problems were discomfort (the feeling that something was in my eye) and obvious redness.  Both issues disappeared when I started taking restsis.

336,effexor,2,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,"the xanax has a calming effect, and takes the edge off the effexor side effects."
337,macrobid,1,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,cured the UTI
338,buprenorphine,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication."

340,doxycycline,4,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I originally began this treatment for acne and I'm still in the process of my acne treatments. However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me."

My breasts went from a full C cup to a full D cup!  I'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  Nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period."
346,synthroid,8,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,"The drug Levothyroxine 100 mics daily that I took for hypothyroidism was advantagious for my metobolic effect. I did have more energy and felt more alert and awake, as before where I felt lithargic and brain dead.If I inadvertantly skipped a day of medication, I felt like I would notice my sluggishness a few days later."
347,elavil,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime ""hangover"" effect and the dose can be increased easily."

423,sumatriptan,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"got rid of migraine pretty quickly, in about half an hour, but was not as good as imitrex, the brand name.

438,elidel,7,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,"It was a cream base that was easy to apply, twice a day.  It seemed to help with an allergic skin rash due to detergent irritation.  It was not as strong as a higher dosage cortisone cream, but it was still effective.  There were no side effects of note.  The cost was higher than over the counter preparations.  All in all, it was a good choice for stubborn skin irritation issues."

I play with the dosage and make my own changes (25 mgs at a time) based on how I'm doing, so I've taken between 200 and 400 mgs at any given time.

449,tramadol,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,When I began taking Tramadol I had severe Arthritis pain and could not sleep more than 3 hours a night. Tramadol relieves the pain without making you feel drugged up. I had to take up to 6 tylenol or 4 ibuprofens and it still did not touch the pain.
450,permapen,1,Ineffective,No Side Effects,"Absolutely no benefits, did not seem to get better even in a week.  Through research I learned that penicillin does not treat a virus and that a virus must run its course.  No idea why my doctor precribed Penicillin.

457,prednisone,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"This medication completely erased symptoms of the hives.  The first time that I took the medication the hives were already 2 days old, therefore, it took about 2 days for them to clear up.

461,imitrex,2,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,"I initially switched over from Axert since my insurance covers more of the Imitrex prescription.  Imitrex just isn't right for me.  I experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat.  On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE!  It comes 9 to a package.  The packaging is a tri-fold ""booklet"" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded.  I  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  Definitely going back to Axert!"
462,xanax,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck."

470,azopt,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"Although this is not available in generic, I am using the generic versions of alphagan and betagan in conjunction with this drug. Each drug was used independently to determine side effects before they were combined for treatment. (This was a many visit process! But the results have made it was worth it) This combination lowered my intraoccular pressure to the point that it was not necessary to have surgery - my next step since other combinations did not work."

478,lyrica,1,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,There was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  I believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  The side effects were so severe I was afraid to drive the car.  My memory and thought process was deeply distrubed and I still felt pain. My thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence I sounded as if I was on drugs.  The side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  I could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  This medication was meant for Diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  I feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  As all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  I would not recommend anyone take it.

Mood disorders."

It appeared one night, not slowly over time. I tried several meds without success before my doctor suggested Remeron. It took a few weeks to take effect but it has been 100% successful for about 17 years now. I used to take up to 45 mg. at bedtime but have ratcheted it down to 15 mg. over the years.

Had more motivation to help myself in other ways - better nutrition, better exercise, self care, etc. Then my body and mind began to kick in and heal itself more.

Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription."

579,keppra,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"We aren't sure.  We wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  We are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  She was on carbatrol with complete control, but was switched to Keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. We hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  The goal is to get her back under complete control."

This medication has had minimal side effects and I developed a tolerance to the side effects in a short period of time- about 30 days. This medication is easy to take and doesn't dissolve on your tongue thus avoiding a bitter pill taste. In its generic form this medication is quite affordable.

Every individual to whom I've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  I'm a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. Once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey, that's science, man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on."

651,imitrex,7,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Since my hypothyroidism is being better treated I rarely get a migraine anymore. I get one every couple of months or so. I have to say that I sort of dread taking the Imitrex because I do experience several side effects, but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. I really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. The increase in heart rate can freak me out too, especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too."

I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning."

Imitrex takes the edge off the pain, takes away the feeling of nausea and I am able to work on the computer, which I otherwise could not do with a migraine. The pills work most of the time but do not work if the headache was not a migraine. The drug used to have an effect quicker on me several years ago when it took care of my migraine within 30 minutes. Today it often takes me an hour to feel better after taking Imitrex."

670,fosamax,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,"No benefits whatsoever, no change in bone density. I took one tablet on the same day each week with plenty of water first thing in the morning and stood upright for the next two hours as I prepared for work. The side effects were numerous and severe, and with continued use compounded themselves to the point that I feared I may not survive the year. My physician at the time refused to believe me and insisted that I continue taking the drug. I began intense research on my own and discovered I was not alone, and would have to make every attempt to save myself."

674,avage,5,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"I didn't notice dramatic results with this product and it was fairly expensive at $100 for one tube. I wasn't religious about applying it each day, so that might have had an impact on the effectiveness. I didn't notice significant fading of the darkest large freckles on my face as I had hoped. I didn't notice any significant reduction in wrinkles."
675,betamethasone,2,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,"After the administration of the first injection the pain decreased, however after a period of two weeks it returned. A second injection was administered. There was no improvement and undesirable side effects, as described below, appeared."

I had tried other methods to quit smoking and this one actually worked! Unfortunately I had a severe allergic reactions to the medication (the main ingredient Wellbutrin).
677,renova,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Early this year I started noticing my skin around the eye beginning to lose its firmness: wrinkles formed during sleep could not be smoothed out by using Lancome eye cream.  Though, applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids, but only on the surface, and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  I was very self conscious about the wrinkles. After using Renova (I've been using it for about two month now), the wrinkles are smoothed, and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up, supple and elastic."

679,wellbutrin,5,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,"I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water."

With 8-10 hours of sleep I'm still very fatigued, but I am able to think more clearly...and even drive again. My mood is much better and seems to be more stable than before. The endless fatigue used to spin me out of control and send me into rage, and the only way that I could deal with the rage was to clean like mad crazy and put my focus on ANYTHING other than the real issues...all the while never eating or drinking anything for weeks at a time. From there I would become extremely manic and focus only on organization, my eating disorder and cleaning. This hasn't happened at all since taking provigal in combination with Cymbalta. I did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania, ocd or eating disorders....but I feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me."

Some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night.

Second, propecia does work even for a receding hairline, if u think your going to regrow your childhood hairline 99% of the time you won't. I have managed to keep my hair and regrow the thin parts and it just feels a lot better. and of course if you take a hormone blocking drug your gonna have sides but they are not bad at all i can still get a boner in about 10 seconds and its not limp. it didnt start really regrowing until about 6-7 months in so u gotta give it time."

It has made most of my bi-polar traits go away.
780,catapres,8,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Catapres was initially effective at reducing my blood pressure on it's own, but there was reduced effectiveness over time. For this reason I began taking Betaloc in addition to catapres (daily). Taking these two drugs together has resulted in good blood pressure control with a fairly low dose of each drug.

Although Nexium is very similar to Prilosec in its formulation, for some reason Nexium allowed my esophageal lining to heal and after a one month treatment, my heartburn is much better as long as I continue to watch my diet."

The cold sore is dried up within 24 hrs. They became unnoticeable to everyone."
954,nortriptyline,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Mood lifted considerably. Able to live life again. Life is much lighter. I am no longer oversensitive, things like life's little injustices don't hurt so much anymore. My daily experiences in this initial period can be followed on: http://nortriptyline.blogspot.com/ where I am keeping a diary.

956,miralax,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"Helped ease constipation without causing discomfort. I have tried many different types of laxatives, fibers, etc to help reduce my problems with constipation. Many laxatives cause extreme cramping and work only the one time. The next day, the problem returns. With Miralax, I took it for the three consecutive days and it worked slowly, but without cramping, and without and discomfort at all. The effects lasted for several weeks -- that is, I had a bowel movement every day, easily. After about three weeks I needed to take it again, but it was only for the three days and then it had the same effect. I have been doing this now for almost a year. I feel significantly better."
957,clarinex,9,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"We tried various allergy medicines including zyrtec, but my son continued to have re-occurring sinuses infections and chronic nasal congestion.  Then we tried clarinex.  This past winter, we were sinuses infection free. The clarinex also cleared up the chronic nasal congestion.  It also helps that he likes the taste of the medicine."
958,augmentin,4,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,"Treatment quickly eliminated discomfort associated with the sinus infection.  These included ear ache, sore throat, and fever.  These symptoms were partially alleviated within 24 hours of the first dose.  Within 48 hours, all symptoms were no longer present.  However, the eliminated symptoms associated with the sinus infection were almost immediately replaced by negative side effects."

968,wellbutrin,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants."
969,acyclovir,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"It is very effective, especially if you take it early enough. But even if you wait till the cold sore is larger, it still stops the growth of cold sores completely, and helps to heal pretty quick. id say within 2-3 days. Its so worth it if you are like me, and get cold sores ALLLLL the time. (at LEAST 10 times a year, no joke) I have to have the medicine with me at all times. The sad thing is, I'm only allowed 4 refills a year, so I have to lower my dosage, but, it still works."

988,retin-a-micro,10,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience."
989,panixine-disperdose,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"My skin became infected from scratching too much and too hard when I had an allergic reaction to a topical skin product.  A day after I started taking the medication, I noticed a decrease in the redness and swelling of the affected skin.  I was prescribed zyrtec in conjunction with the antibiotic but it causes severe drowsiness.  My doctor had me discontinue the zyrtec and see how I did with the cephalexin alone.  I continued to heal faster than I think I would have without the medication."
990,ultracet,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,I WAS LIVING WITH PAIN IN MOST OF THE MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS OF MY BODY.  IT HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF HAVING TO HAVE HELP TO GET OUT OF BED.  WHEN THERE WAS A FLARE-UP I HAD TO GO TO BED. TRAMADOL HCL COMBINED WITH CYMBALATA REDUCED MY PAIN BY ABOUT 85%!  MADE MY LIFE LIVABLE AGAIN.  I'M THANKFUL THAT I HUNG IN THROUGH THE SIDE EFFECTS OF CYMBALATA.  IT TOOK OVER A YEAR TO FIND THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF DRUGS AND I'M THANKFUL THAT FINALLY DID.

I eat one fish fillet or chicken breast/day, nothing else, now gaining 3-6 lbs./month!  Since I can't find a Dr. who will treat my T3 I'm ordering Cytomel online, from what I've read it's the ticket to eliminate hypo symptoms.  Shame on physicians who treat lab results rather than the patient.  I don't care what the numbers are, I still feel awful!"
994,doxycycline,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I have tried various alternatives to penicillin and this has been the best. I had a nasty cat bite (a tooth stuck in my bone, so it was deep). I was told I was highly likely to get a a deep and painful infection given the depth of the bite. So I was warned to take all of these or I'd be back later for IV treatment and it would be a far longer course. Well, I took 8 of the 10 days prescribed and not only did I never get an infection, I had few side effects. There was, perhaps, a slight stomach upset but not even enough to need what I standardly use -- yogurt. I'd recommend this to those who need a penicillin replacement."
995,chantix,1,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,"The treatment benefits were smoking cessation, first a gradual reduction 2-10 a day then 1-2 a day  then I quit for 2 weeks"

1002,flexeril,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,I woke up with a more relaxed jaw. I have bruxism which is the medical term for the grinding of teeth or the clenching of jaws. So if I have alot of tension in my jaw before I go to bed I will grind my teeth which will lead to migraines. Taking Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) before I go to bed helps me avoid waking up in pain due to Bruxism.
1003,sular,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,My blood pressure was out of control. My doctors had prescribed diuretics (limited effectiveness) and other forms of calcium channel blockers. This in my opinion is a wonder drug!My blood pressure had shot up so badly that I would get nosebleeds when working on my knees or bending over.My pressure was in the triple digits at times.
1004,effexor-xr,2,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last 15 years (all of the SSRI category) or so, and I can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression, as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over."

I use bare mineral makeup to minimize oil

1011,buspar,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"As a former drug addict, I flat refused anything that would be addictive. ie diazepam, tamazepam, etc. My doctor suggested buspar as it was not addictive, and yet had similar effects to diazepam. He prescribed it on a prn basis, and i was sceptical. However, within 20 minutes of taking it, the effects were astounding. Anxiety subsided, and a feeling of warmness enveloped me. One dose lasted about 5 hours, and did not inhibit any other aspect of my day to day activites. It also helped with my disrupted sleep patterns."

1016,mevacor,2,Marginally Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,"I believe the treatment at the lower 10 mg dose was effective in reducing the serverity of my brain lesions. I also believe I was thinking more clearly afterwards than I was prior to starting on lovastatin. A brain MRI taken a year after starting on Lovastatin indicated the lesions had reduced a bit, but that was not confirmed by my doctor as my previous MRI had been lost when I changed doctors."
1017,seroquel,1,Marginally Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,"As a caregiver, I did not see any benefits, the patient continued to have problems with insomnia"
1018,risperdal,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,"There were no known benefits. I truly believed that the doctor that prescribed me this stupid medication should rot in hell. There are too many side effects, especially long term ones. 

The worst part is, they did not even tell me how and why their diagnosis was accurate. they just prescribe drugs left and right as if they had no conscience or they are evil people just out for the money."

After Dr upped dosage to 450 mgs per day i have never felt better. Use to be extremely emotional, weepy, and just did not want to get out of bed. It has helped with my symptoms from the fibromyalgia, and my anxiety. It has also helped me drop weight which is a bonus too."

I've heard other people say the same thing about feeling ""normal.""  I would still get down but it wouldn't last for days.  I could get through it like a healthy-minded person.  It was such a relief from what I had been feeling.  I told myself that I would take it forever if I had to......anything to not feel what I had been feeling for years:  depressed that I'm not good enough."
1034,lorazepam,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,The prescription was given for anxiety and to help with sleep during long flights and when under high anxiety situations. Lorazepam helped to calm and induced drowziness. I would not recomend this if you have to stay alert as it can make functioning dificult.
1035,voltaren,3,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,Stop the pain
1036,elavil,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,Actually the Amitriptyline greatly helped with getting to sleep each night as an added benefit.

1040,toradol,3,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,I took this drug for pain relief due to surgery (laproscopically assisted hysterectomy). Although the pain I experienced wasn't great the drug did relieve it but the side effects were not worth it.

I had developed some facial hair over the past few years and grew tired of tweezing and waxing. The treatment took a few months to work, but over time has minimized the hair growth. I will continue to use this as it is a very simple once a day application."
1049,clonazepam,5,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Taking the rivotril made me sleepy at first but then it just calmed me down enough to be able to cope with life.  I was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before I didn't have any situations I considered safe.  It helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life."
1050,elavil,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Since I was very young, a child, I suffered debilatating headaches.  Often they became true migraines.  They would last for days and days, sometimes weeks
without stop.  I missed school, parties, holidays.  I was scared to make plans
to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil
and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management
physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When
I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from
Elavil.  Thank you Elavil."
1051,metrogel,4,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I found metro gel to be irritating and drying. My face seemed more red than before I started taking it. It was actually uncomfortable from dryness. I did not want to use the cream because it seemed to be heavy, possibly leading to breakouts. My doctor then gave me a presciption for noritate, which did not have the side effects I mentioned above. Plus, you only have to use it once per day, which I like alot."

without stop.  I missed school, parties, holidays.  I was scared to make plans
to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil
and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management
physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When
I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from
Elavil.  Thank you Elavil."

There are so many looking for the magical drug for weight loss but there is none. Exercise is the magical word.

I then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  I could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. 
I used a thin smear of Acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped iritating within an hour or so and died back.  If I left the cream off - they would start again.  I persisted with the cream daily for 2 weeks and for the first time in 10 years or more my arm is 'wart free' and I have healthy unbroken wart free skin."

1304,ortho-tri-cyclen,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,Of all of the birthcontrol pills I've taken this was by far the one with the least number of negative side effects and it actually had several positive side effects.  It helped control my acne and kept me thin.  After several years I did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after I stopped taking birthcontrol pills altogether.  I was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and I had a completely different reaction.  I instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight I think because I looked puffy).  I found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  I learned the hard way.

Gradually I noticed that I didn't need as much so I cut back on my dose. Eventually I went off for a year or two.  Then when I noticed the old symptoms of mild depression, tiredness, sugar cravings etc., I went back on.  I found that the natural form of Armour allowed my thyroid to kickstart.

Thankfully I do not need to use albuterol daily, as I know some people do, but I use it as needed when I am experiencing an asthma attach. This happens on average once a month, less in warmer months, more during the winder.

As far as being effective albuterol, and the name brand inhaler is the best, and to my knowledge, still the only small inhaler that really works. I'm sure it has saved lives.

To sleep was good, but morning psychedelic effect no good.

Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health.

It helped me to get control of my life and avoid the severe depressions I was prone to, as well as putting a cap on my manias. I still felt mild highs or maybe natural euphorias but they are not manic-y and crazy. I even started being able to get sleepy at a normal hour and wake up in the morning. While on the medication I feel much clearer in general in my thoughts, so if I still feel down or up I am more confident in my ability to manage it.

One important note: do not scrub the face with washcloths or any other abrasive products, and use plenty of moisturizer. Scrubbing makes the irritation and pimples worse."

1684,imitrex,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"I had my first migraine at age 10 and suffered for almost 60 years. Then Imitrex--a miracle!  Imitrex, finally, gave me my life back. As I get older and am now retired (72) and have less stress, I use the stat dose once or never during the year. The 50mg tablet usually returns me to normal within an hour. A ""generic"" has become available but is less Imitrex and more Naprosin, an anti-inflammatory,  which is cheaper for the manufacturer but not good long-term for the patient. My doctor is keeping me on the brand name. However, Humana has dropped Imitrex coverage, not wanting to pay the high cost, which never gets lower as the manufacturer won't release the patent.  Now I'm worried, having to pay the entire cost myself, which is impossible.  It's a horrible dilemma.  I can't pay for it and they won't.  What now?"

It seems that this happens in two ways; first, I do feel full most of the time, even though I feel some low blood sugar weakness that comes with weight loss.  The other part is that I just don't seem to care as much about eating, feeling weak, full, ect.  This is a nice mental shift which makes my weight loss plan feel like natural, like a life style change.  I just don't care about food that much and am able to think about other things.  Also, I have noticed that I when I am tempted to snack, I am able to see that I am usually emotionally stressed about something, so it is easier to think of another way to deal with my emotions and anxiety.

I was unable to get out of bed before I started treatment, and now I am back to having an interest in life.  It doesn't make me nauseous, which is a huge plus as far as I'm concerned.  I like that it doesn't cause weight gain or sexual side effects.
I was happy that it only made me feel mildly nauseous for a day or so.  I feel nearly back to normal emotionally.  I was concerned that it made my hands quite shaky for awhile, but after a reduced my caffeine intake, that subsided.  My only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.  It is generally easy to ignore during the day, but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep."
1803,lyrica,3,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,I really could not give any results as I had a severe reaction to the medicine. I broke out in a rash on my elbow to my wrist area and also swelling of my eyes one morning. That is when I stopped taking it approx. 4 days into it.

1806,wellbutrin-xl,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Helped my depression considerably.  Also, out of all depression medication I have taken since 1994, I have been able to stop taking Wellbutrin the longest before depression symptoms returned, so I believe eventually I may be able to stop taking Wellbutrin and not have depression symptoms return."

1810,vicodin,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"I chose to take vicodin instead of an ibuprofin based pain killer because my holistic doctor believes ibuprofin  slows healing time.

1817,zoloft,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 

Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them."

Lumigan contains the same active ingredient that Latisse will contain when it is released but the difference is that Lumigan is prescribed as a glaucoma medication while Latisse will be marketed and sold as an eyelash growth product.  It does work."

1825,claritin,9,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.

I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  Many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if Claritin is approved by your MD for use while nursing, why not try it?  Or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds."

MAO-Inhibitors like Parnate worked very well for me, except all of my favorite foods were forbidden.

It soothed the irritation and lessened the dermatitis rather quickly however, it was also used for what was thought as dermatitis around the mouth. Use continued for six months with no results. The rash was exacerbated by heat and a diagnosis of MRSA was made. The Clobex, due to steroids in the cream, did not clear the lesions but rather made them worse. Use was discontinued and Bactroban and Septra DS was highly effective at clearing the infection. Have since had no need for Clobex and have used alternate methods for any incidental dermatitis that may occur. For those who chose to traditional medications, I can recommend Clobex for mild to severe dermatitis.

2113,betaseron,8,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,"Storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition,  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.  So this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and I believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  Which, if you have ms this is what you aim for."

Two of them became very ill and it was several weeks before they coudl go back to work.  Their general energy levevls were low for about 2 months.

2126,lexapro,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"happier, slept better. The Lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the Trazadone with sleep. Together they worked quite well, I thought, as I was peppier during the day and slept well at night. So all in all, I would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation, which contributed to depression, low energy, and anxiety. I felt cured"

I missed so much school, work and family events that I became unrealiable which later brought on depression. I still suffer today 44 years later with them but they are not as severe and I can now function in life somewhat normal. Imitrex gave me a chance to live my life the way I wanted to!"

The effects totally calmed me, enabling me to resume my 'normal' life.

My experience is that the fluoxetine have taken away the extreme mood swings."
2133,meridia,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"Lost 15 pounds and did not feel hungry while taking the medicine. On days that I forgot to take a capsule, I did feel hungry and it was not as easy to stick to my diet."

The first dermatologist to prescribe it wanted to put me on several weeks of antibiotics.  I really did not want the systemic side effects of that.  Also, I oppose the overuse of antibiotics because it leads to resistant bacteria.  So one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics."
2143,fosamax,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,"none whatsoever as i was only on it for 6 months . I had no nhealth problems prior to taking this drug to help my bone density, it nonly created havoc with my previous good health."
2144,fosamax,4,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Fosamax tended to hold the line, i.e., my bone density did not progress rapidly.
It never increased the density.  The density decreased gradually."
2145,lamictal,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,"The wellbutrin and effexor alone did improve the depression but the addition of the lamictal really made a significant improvement.  With just the two antidepressants I could still feel down and unmotivated, lethargic, hopeless at times.  But the lamictal prevented me from going down.  I have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and I have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.

2366,effexor-xr,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex)."
2367,bystolic,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.

I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.

I feel pretty normal.  One key to making this work is to deliberately not urinate too often.  I have noticed that now I sometimes need to remind myself to go.

Instead of having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night, I was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night."
2497,wellbutrin,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"The idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  At day 10 the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  I did this and found that in fact by day 8 or 9 I felt an eversion to smoking.  
Niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. 
The prescription is typically for 3 months but I didn't need any refills at all.  I stopped taking the drug after a month or so.
I recommend this drug ONLY UNDER THE CARE OF A PHYSICIAN to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  
Certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money."

I have been on it for years now, the benefits outweighs the disadvantages- I know Im addicted. Azor was and still is prescribed to me by my psychiatrist."
2505,xanax,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck."

The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been.

Some would see it as a benefit to not have an appetite, even though it's bad for your health to not eat.  My depression went away with Lamictal.  Even when I had an appetite I still wouldn't eat much, which helped me greatly, since Epilim gave me terrible cravings."

I could have just taken Benadryl, and although it would have taken longer to recover from the allergic reaction (possibly another week), I would have been normal without side effects, and without withdrawal effects.  The drug took a modest problem and created a far worse one.  I told the physician I reacted strongly to drugs.

3106,micardis,4,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,The drug Micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  My blood pressure is still higher than I or my doctor would like it to be. At the moment it averages about 140 over 90 but it was 180 over 110. Therefore I would say it was somewhat efficacious. It also alleviated some headaches that I assume were blood pressure related.
